# Parallel Word Counter

> This is my simplified demo project of ***parralel file reading and processing***.

> Objective is to ***select Top 20 most frequent words*** within all files ASAP.

> Idea:  ***1 text file per 1 Thread***

All ready for processing text files are stored at the same Map:
```
ConcurrentHashMap<String, LongAdder>
```

Processed files moved to separate folder.


This ***multi-module project consists of 3 separate parts***:
> * File Upload Service (REST WS (Back-End))
> * Word Counter Service (REST WS (Back-End))
> * Spring Boot Web App + Boostrap (Front-End)


1. Upload text files (multi-file upload)
2. List of files could be seen if pressed get list and go to the bottom (on the right side demo boxes for more attractive view) 

Itâ€™s purpose is to demonstrate my knowledge of technologies listed below:

* Git multi-module project
* Spring Boot, Bootstrap, JQuery (Front End)
* 2 REST services
*	Java 8 Lambda
*	Dockerfile file (to run on Docker)
*	Docker Composer file (to Docker Composer)


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (or VM) for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

To test the project, the sw listed bellow need to be installed first:

 1. Java JDK 8 (or higher)
 2. git client
 3. maven build tool
 4. docker
 5. docker-composer

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running



Clone project repo on test VM (or anywhere):

```
git clone https://github.com/min2ha/WordCounterSolution.git
```

Build project:

```
mvn clean package
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

```
docker-compose up
```

## Running

After docker-compose was executed sucessfully, you should be able to test:

http://localhost:8833/fileuploadservice/api

http://localhost:8855/wordcounterservice/api

Management should be done over Front End Web App:
http://localhost:8877/wordcounterwebapp
